# Who Is Good at Lying or Detecting?

## Introduction

Although most people lie occasionally, there are striking individual differences (broad variability) in both the ability to tell convincing lies and the skill of detecting deception in others. Popular culture celebrates the idea of “human lie detectors” and “master liars,” yet empirical research paints a more nuanced picture. Key features in understanding the characteristics of effective liars and lie detectors are personality traits, professional training, and contextual influences.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## General Accuracy in Deception Detection

Across hundreds of studies, ordinary people perform only slightly better than chance when judging whether others are lying. @bondAccuracyDeceptionJudgments2006b reported an average accuracy rate of about 54%, just above the 50% expected by guessing. Importantly, accuracy tends to be symmetrical: people are equally poor at detecting truths and lies. This finding challenges the stereotype that deception is easily spotted by intuition.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Who Lies Convincingly?

### Personality Traits

Certain personality characteristics are linked to the ability to deceive convincingly:

\- **Machiavellianism**: Individuals high in Machiavellianism are strategic and manipulative, traits that facilitate effective lying @christieStudiesMachiavellianism1970.\
- **Psychopathy**: Lack of empathy and guilt may reduce the affective cues typically associated with lying, making detection harder [@jonasonWhatTangledWeb2014].\
- **Narcissism**: Narcissistic individuals may lie to maintain a grandiose self-image, and their charm can enhance credibility [@paulhusDarkTriadPersonality2002].

Conversely, high levels of **agreeableness** and **honesty–humility** are negatively associated with lying frequency and effectiveness [@ashtonHonestySixthFactor2000].

### Social Skills and Acting Ability

One eminent researcher suggests that people with strong social skills, such as professional actors, can produce more convincing lies by controlling expressions and maintaining consistency [@vrijGoodLiars2010] .

Similarly, poker players and negotiators are often skilled at withholding or misrepresenting information strategically [@palomakiMachiavelliPokerMate2016].

### Practice and Prolific Lying

The “prolific liar” hypothesis proposes that frequent liars become more skilled through practice. Habitual liars may learn which strategies work and how to adapt their lies to different audiences (Serota & Levine, 2015).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Who Detects Lies Accurately?

### Baseline Human Limitations

In general, humans are not natural lie detectors. Factors such as the **truth-default bias**—the tendency to assume others are truthful—lower accuracy but also reduce false-positive errors [@serotaFewProlificLiars2015].

### Professional Groups

Certain professional groups, such as law enforcement officers, judges, and customs officials, have been studied for enhanced lie detection ability. Results are mixed:

\- Some studies report modestly higher accuracy among professionals trained in interviewing techniques [@vrijElicitingInformationDetecting2014].\
- Other research finds no significant advantage over laypeople, and in some cases, professionals exhibit overconfidence in their judgments [@kassinImInnocentEffects1999].

### Training and Structured Techniques

Training can improve accuracy, but only when it involves evidence-based methods. For example:

\- **Cognitive load techniques** (asking suspects to recount events in reverse order) increase deception cues [@vrijImposingCognitiveLoad2012].\
- **Strategic questioning** and **unexpected questions** can reveal inconsistencies [@hartwigDetectingDeceptionStrategic2005].\
- In contrast, training based on stereotypes of deception (e.g., avoiding eye contact) does not improve accuracy and may even reduce it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Contextual Factors

### Stakes

The effectiveness of liars and detectors varies by context. High-stakes lies (e.g., in forensic settings) produce stronger emotional and cognitive effects, potentially offering more cues for detection. Low-stakes lies (e.g., in everyday conversation) may pass unnoticed due to their triviality.

### Preparation

Prepared lies are often more convincing than spontaneous ones, as rehearsing reduces inconsistencies and cognitive load. Conversely, spontaneous lies are more prone to “leakage.”

### Relationship Closeness

Familiarity between liar and target affects outcomes. Friends and partners may detect each other’s lies slightly better than strangers, but this is offset by a greater motivation to believe one another, which reduces scepticism (Anderson et al., 2002).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

The evidence suggests that while some individuals may be somewhat better at lying or detecting lies, the differences are modest and context-dependent. Traits such as Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and acting skill may confer advantages in lying, while structured interviewing and specific training can enhance detection accuracy. However, there are no consistently reliable “human lie detectors.” Instead, both lying and detection are shaped by an interplay of personality, practice, context, and strategy.
