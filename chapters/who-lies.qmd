# Who Lies? Why, To Whom, About What?

## Overview
Deception research asks not only *how* people lie but also *who* engages in lying most often, *why* they do so, *to whom* they lie, and *about what kinds of issues*. This sketch introduces you to the distribution of lying in the population, its links with personality, contextual factors, and the typical targets of deception.

## Distribution of Lying
- Most people report lying rarely.  
- A small group of “prolific liars” accounts for the majority of lies (Serota & Levine, 2015).  
- This distribution is highly skewed, resembling “80/20” patterns found in other behaviors.

**Case Example:**  
In a U.S. diary study, over 60% of participants reported telling no lies on a given day, while just 5% accounted for nearly half of all reported lies (Serota, Levine, & Boster, 2010).

## Personality Correlates
- **Dark Triad traits** (Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy) predict higher deception rates (Paulhus & Williams, 2002).  
- **Agreeableness** and **honesty–humility** negatively predict lying (Ashton & Lee, 2007).  
- Extraverts may lie more frequently in casual settings simply due to greater social interaction (Kashy & DePaulo, 1996).

## Contextual Influences
- **Hierarchy:** Lies are often told upward to authority (e.g., employees to supervisors).  
- **Medium:** Digital media afford anonymity and more frequent low-stakes lies (Hancock et al., 2004).  
- **Lie content:** White lies are often tolerated; self-serving lies attract disapproval (Levine, 2014).

## Targets of Lies
- **Strangers:** Frequent, low-consequence lies.  
- **Friends:** Lies are less frequent but often protective.  
- **Romantic partners:** Less frequent but more consequential (DePaulo & Kashy, 1998).  
- **Parents/authority:** Common during adolescence (Jensen et al., 2004).

## FAQ
**Q: Do men and women differ in lying?**  
Small differences exist: men lie slightly more for self-promotion, women slightly more for relationship maintenance, but effects are modest (DePaulo et al., 1996).  

**Q: Are prolific liars always untrustworthy?**  
Not necessarily. Some specialize in trivial “white lies,” but over time credibility is at risk.  

**Q: How does culture shape lying?**  
Collectivist cultures may justify “other-oriented” lies to preserve harmony, while individualist cultures may tolerate self-promotion lies more readily (Fu et al., 2008).

## Key Takeaways
- A minority of individuals account for most lies.  
- Dark Triad traits predict lying, whereas agreeableness and honesty–humility reduce it.  
- Context (hierarchy, medium, lie type) shapes deception patterns.  
- Who people lie to varies by relational closeness and accountability.
