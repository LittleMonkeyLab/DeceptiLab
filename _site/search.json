    "text": "Three Theoretical Frameworks\n\nTheory\n\nMeso-level accounts examine the interaction between liar and recipient (Vrij et al., 2019):\n1. Moral Psychology Account (Bond & DePaulo, 2006)\nPeople judge others’ lies as immoral but excuse their own. Distancing from moral responsibility enables self-serving evaluations (Shu et al., 2011; Shalvi et al., 2015).\n2. Self-Presentational Theory (DePaulo, 1992; Goffman, 1959)\nBoth liars and truth-tellers manage impressions. Liars describe more strategies than truth-tellers (Hartwig et al., 2007). Self-deception may help convince others (Trivers, 2011).\n3. Interpersonal Deception Theory (IDT) (Buller & Burgoon, 1996)\nFocuses on dynamic interaction with real-time behavioral adjustments. Liars seek conversational control (Burgoon et al., 2014). Engages theory of mind networks (Christ et al., 2009)."

Key findings:\n\nNonverbal cues to deception are faint and unreliable (effect sizes typically d &lt; 0.30)\nHuman detection accuracy is only ~54% (barely above chance of 50%)\nVerbal cues are more diagnostic than nonverbal cues\nPeople hold widespread misconceptions about deception cues (e.g., gaze aversion, fidgeting)\nVisual-only detection is least accurate; audio-only is more effective\nTraining based on nonverbal cues produces minimal improvements\nTheoretical frameworks include cognitive load, emotional leakage, self-presentation, and interpersonal deception theory\nFuture research should examine settings where nonverbal analysis is essential and develop more precise measurements\n\nCritical insight: Despite popular belief and media portrayals, there is no “Pinocchio’s nose” — no reliable nonverbal sign of deception exists.\n\nReference\nVrij, A., Hartwig, M., & Granhag, P.

Key findings:\n\nNonverbal cues to deception are faint and unreliable (effect sizes typically d &lt; 0.30)\nHuman detection accuracy is only ~54% (barely above chance of 50%)\nVerbal cues are more diagnostic than nonverbal cues\nPeople hold widespread misconceptions about deception cues (e.g., gaze aversion, fidgeting)\nVisual-only detection is least accurate; audio-only is more effective\nTraining based on nonverbal cues produces minimal improvements\nTheoretical frameworks include cognitive load, emotional leakage, self-presentation, and interpersonal deception theory\nFuture research should examine settings where nonverbal analysis is essential and develop more precise measurements\n\nCritical insight: Despite popular belief and media portrayals, there is no “Pinocchio’s nose” — no reliable nonverbal sign of deception exists.\n\nReference\nVrij, A., Hartwig, M., & Granhag, P.
