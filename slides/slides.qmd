## Deception

::: callout-note
Deception - a “process by which one individual deliberately attempts to
convince another person to accept as true what the liar knows to be
false, typically for the liar \[...\] to gain some type of benefit or to
avoid loss”
:::

## Deception Research in Psychology

We might ask:

-   *how* people lie but also *who* engages in lying most often, *why*
    they do so, *to whom* they lie, and *about what kinds of issues*.
-   Why do people lie?
-   To whom do people lie?
-   What does it feel like to lie?
-   What does it feel like to detect a lie?

## A week without lying

![](/images/Aweekwithoutlying.png)

## Who Lies? Why, To Whom, About What?

-   Distribution: most lies by a minority of prolific liars
-   Personality correlates: Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy;
    agreeableness (−)
-   Contexts: authority vs peers; online vs offline; white lies vs
    self-serving

## How Do People Lie? Channels & Strategies

-   Channels: face, body, voice, text
-   Strategies: faking good, faking bad, malingering, charm, feigned
    friendship
-   Preparation vs spontaneity; leakage vs control

## The Experience of Lying & Being Lied To

-   Affective: guilt, anxiety, “duper’s delight”
-   Cognitive: load, monitoring, self-presentation
-   Social: trust repair, suspicion spirals

## Detecting Deception

-   Linguistics: pronouns, negations, specificity, temporal structure
-   Nonverbal: illustrators, adaptors, gaze (weak/variable indicators)
-   Physiology: heart rate, skin conductance; constraints & ethics
-   Modality: Audio, Visual, Audio-visual etc

## Who is good at detecting lies?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Experimental Paradigms

-   Cheating tasks (dice/coin, matrices)
-   Mock-crime with interviews
-   “Deception Olympics” style tournaments

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## AI as Judge

-   Text models score linguistic cues on transcripts
-   Computer vision for facial dynamics and gaze
-   Caveats: dataset bias, context, ethics, generalization

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Case Studies

1.  Shalvi et al. (2011) cheating & justification
    [@shalviJustifiedEthicalityObserving2011]
2.  DePaulo et al. (1996) everyday lie diaries
    [@depauloLyingEverydayLife1996]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Where Next? Sub-Projects

-   Lie diaries (1 week)
-   Mock-crime detection and forenci interviewing
-   Faking friendship micro-interactions
-   AI vs human detectors on transcripts, audio, video
-   Emotion displays during deception (Guilt, Anxiety, Cognitive Load &
    Delight)
-   Personality & deception success
