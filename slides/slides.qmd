## Deception Research in Psychology

We ask: *Who lies, why, how, with what experience, and how can we detect it?*

---

## Who Lies? Why, To Whom, About What?

- Distribution: most lies by a minority of prolific liars
- Personality correlates: Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy; agreeableness (−)
- Contexts: authority vs peers; online vs offline; white lies vs self-serving

::: notes
Anchor to class discussion: frequency distributions; everyday vs high-stakes.

## How Do People Lie? Channels & Strategies

- Channels: face, body, voice, text
- Strategies: faking good, faking bad, malingering, charm, feigned friendship
- Preparation vs spontaneity; leakage vs control

---

## The Experience of Lying & Being Lied To

- Affective: guilt, anxiety, “duper’s delight”
- Cognitive: load, monitoring, self-presentation
- Social: trust repair, suspicion spirals

---

## Detecting Deception

- Linguistics: pronouns, negations, specificity, temporal structure
- Nonverbal: illustrators, adaptors, gaze (weak/variable indicators)
- Physiology: heart rate, skin conductance; constraints & ethics

---

## Who Is Good at Lying or Detecting?

- Accuracy ~ chance for naïve observers
- Trained interviewers sometimes better; mixed evidence
- High Machs/actors/poker players—candidate “good liars”

---

## Experimental Paradigms

- Cheating tasks (dice/coin, matrices)
- Mock-crime with interviews
- “Deception Olympics” style tournaments

---

## AI as Judge

- Text models score linguistic cues on transcripts
- Computer vision for facial dynamics and gaze
- Caveats: dataset bias, context, ethics, generalization

---

## Case Studies

1. Shalvi et al. (2011) cheating & justification [@Shalvi2011]
2. DePaulo et al. (1996) everyday lie diaries [@DePaulo1996]

---

## Where Next? Sub-Projects

- Lie diaries (1 week)
- Mock-crime detection lab
- Faking friendship micro-interactions
- AI vs human detectors on transcripts
- Emotion during deception
- Personality & deception success

---

## Takeaways

- No single “Pinocchio” cue
- Combine methods + context
- Do the science: build and test
