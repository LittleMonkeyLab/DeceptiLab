### Core Definition

"A process by which one individual deliberately attempts to convince another person to accept as true what the liar knows to be false, typically for the liar to gain some type of benefit or to avoid loss."

— Vrij (2000, p. 15)
:::

**The Intentionality Debate:** Most definitions emphasize intentional deception (Chisholm & Feehan, 1977; DePaulo et al., 2003), though some argue lying can occur without intent to mislead (Smith, 2007).
::::
::::::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Deception Landscape {.content-slide}

::: slug-header
Theory
:::

**How often do people lie?**

- Diary studies: ~2 lies per day; 20–31% of interactions involve deception (DePaulo et al., 1996)
- Distribution is highly skewed: ~5% of people tell ~50% of all lies (Serota et al., 2010, 2021)
- Truth is the default: most people tell the truth most of the time

**Why do people lie?**

- Lie aversion: people forgo gains to avoid lying (Abeler et al., 2012; Gneezy, 2005)
- Motivations: self vs. other; gain vs. loss (DePaulo, 1996; Vrij, 2008)
- "Butler lies" maintain relationships (Hancock, 2009)
- More willing to lie for charity than self (Yin et al., 2017)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Individual & Cultural Differences {.content-slide}

::: slug-header
Theory
:::

**Pathological lying:** Compulsive, not goal-driven; linked to low self-esteem and neurocognitive deficits (Poletti, 2011)

**Prolific liars:** Score high in Machiavellianism; manage consistency well (Kashy & DePaulo, 1996; El Haj, 2017)

**Culture matters:**

- Collectivist cultures: lie to protect relationships (Bessarabova, 2014; Park, 2018)
- Individualist cultures: prioritize personal integrity
- Frequent liars are not necessarily less moral (Halevy, 2014)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Three Theoretical Frameworks {.content-slide}

::: slug-header
Theory
:::

Meso-level accounts examine the interaction between liar and recipient (Vrij et al., 2019):

**1. Moral Psychology Account** (Bond & DePaulo, 2006)

People judge others' lies as immoral but excuse their own. Distancing from moral responsibility enables self-serving evaluations (Shu et al., 2011; Shalvi et al., 2015).

**2. Self-Presentational Theory** (DePaulo, 1992; Goffman, 1959)

Both liars and truth-tellers manage impressions. Liars describe more strategies than truth-tellers (Hartwig et al., 2007). Self-deception may help convince others (Trivers, 2011).

**3. Interpersonal Deception Theory (IDT)** (Buller & Burgoon, 1996)

Focuses on dynamic interaction with real-time behavioral adjustments. Liars seek conversational control (Burgoon et al., 2014). Engages theory of mind networks (Christ et al., 2009).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cognitive & Emotional Accounts {.content-slide}

::: slug-header
Theory
:::

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Cognitive Demands**

Four-factor theory (Zuckerman et al., 1981):

- Cognitive load
- Emotional experience
- Behavior control
- Physiological arousal

Deception requires inhibiting truth and constructing coherent false stories (Baddeley, 2007).

Evidence: fMRI shows executive function overlap (Christ et al., 2009); longer response latencies (Suchotzki et al., 2017); time pressure promotes honesty.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Emotional Experience**

Leakage hypothesis: emotions may "leak" via body more than face (Ekman & Friesen, 1969).

**Critical issue:** Truth-tellers may also show anxiety (Vrij et al., 2006). Emotional displays are not diagnostic of deception.

**Four emotional experiences:**

- Guilt (norm violation)
- Anxiety (fear of detection)
- Cognitive load (mental effort)
- "Duper's delight" (success pleasure)
:::
::::::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Truth Bias & Detection Accuracy {.content-slide}

::: slug-header
Theory
:::

**The Truth Bias**

People judge others as truthful more often than they actually are (Bond & DePaulo, 2006).

Explanations:

- Spinozan mind: belief is automatic (Gilbert, 1991)
- Truth-Default Theory: we default to truth (Levine, 2014)
- Adaptive Lie Detector: functional decision-making (Street, 2015)

**Human Detection Performance**

- ~54% accuracy (chance = 50%) (Bond & DePaulo, 2006)
- No reliable behavioral signal found (DePaulo et al., 2003)
- Training, confidence, or profession have little effect (Aamodt & Custer, 2006)
- Recent developments: active elicitation techniques show promise (Nahari, 2019; Vrij & Granhag, 2012)

# PART 2: PIECES OF THE PUZZLE {.section-divider}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Four Research Domains {.content-slide}

::: slug-header
Pieces of the Puzzle
:::

Your mini-dissertation can focus on one domain or combine multiple:

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**THE LIAR**

Who lies? Who's good at it? What strategies do they use? What's the experience like?

**THE LIE**

What does deception look like? What are the linguistic and structural features?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**THE DETECTOR**

Who's good at detecting? What cues do they use? What's the experience of being deceived?

**THE CONTEXT**

How do modality, relationship, culture, and stakes affect deception?
:::
::::::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## THE LIAR {.content-slide}

::: slug-header
Pieces of the Puzzle
:::

**Who lies?**

- Distribution: most lies by minority of prolific liars
- Personality correlates: Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy; low agreeableness
- Contexts: authority vs. peers; online vs. offline; white lies vs. self-serving

**Who is good at lying?**

High Machs, actors, poker players are candidate "good liars" (Vrij, 2010; Verigin et al., 2019)

**How do people lie?**

Channels: face, body, voice, text | Strategies: faking good/bad, malingering, charm, feigned friendship

**The experience of lying:** Affective (guilt, anxiety, delight), cognitive (load, monitoring), social (trust dynamics, suspicion)

**Qualitative opportunities:** Interviews with prolific liars, diary studies, life history approaches

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## THE LIE {.content-slide}

::: slug-header
Pieces of the Puzzle
:::

**Linguistic Cues to Deception**

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Fewer first-person pronouns (self-distancing)
- More negations (denial)
- Less specific (avoid details)
- Less complex temporal structure (cognitive load)
- More negative emotion words (anxiety/guilt)
- Fewer social words (avoid connection)
- Less complex language overall
- Variable certainty (convince vs. uncertainty)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Less diverse vocabulary (cognitive load)
- Less readable (cognitive load)
- Fewer words total (avoid details)
- More qualifiers (uncertainty)
- More repetitions (convince)
- More psychological distancing
:::
::::::

**Important:** These cues are probabilistic, not deterministic. Context matters.

**Qualitative opportunities:** Discourse analysis of lie construction, narrative analysis of structure, thematic content patterns

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## THE DETECTOR {.content-slide}

::: slug-header
Pieces of the Puzzle
:::

**Who is good at detecting lies?**

- High empathy and social skills may help
- Training helps minimally
- Humans achieve ~54% accuracy
- "Wizards" exist but are rare (ten Brinke et al., 2014; Levinson, 2020)

**What cues are used?**

- Linguistics: pronouns, negations, specificity, temporal structure
- Nonverbal: illustrators, adaptors, gaze (**generally weak and variable**)
- Physiology: heart rate, skin conductance (constraints & ethics)
- Modality: audio, visual, audio-visual effects

**The experience of being deceived:** Betrayal, doubt, rumination, trust erosion, relationship damage

**Qualitative opportunities:** Interviews with expert detectors, think-aloud protocols, case studies, ethnographic observation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## THE CONTEXT {.content-slide}

::: slug-header
Pieces of the Puzzle
:::

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Modality Effects**

![](../images/modality.png){width="100%"}

Meta-analyses show:

- Audio-visual > audio or visual alone
- Audio > visual (paralanguage cues)
- Visual alone least effective
- Text-based detection possible
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Other Contextual Factors**

Relationship dynamics:

- Authority vs. peer relationships
- Intimate vs. casual relationships
- Online vs. offline contexts

Stakes and consequences:

- High-stakes vs. low-stakes lies
- Social vs. material consequences
- Legal/forensic vs. everyday contexts

Culture:

- Collectivist vs. individualist
- Display rules for emotion
- Acceptability of different lie types
:::
::::::

**Qualitative opportunities:** Situational analysis, context mapping, comparative ethnography across cultures

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Integration Example {.content-slide}

::: slug-header
Pieces of the Puzzle
:::

**Example Study: Text-Based Deception by High Machs**

- **THE LIAR:** Participants scoring high in Machiavellianism
- **THE LIE:** Linguistic analysis using LIWC (pronouns, negations, certainty)
- **THE DETECTOR:** Human judges and AI algorithm attempt detection
- **THE CONTEXT:** Text modality with varying stakes conditions

**Mixed methods approach:**

- Quantitative: Linguistic feature analysis, detection accuracy, personality correlations
- Qualitative: Post-task interviews about strategies, thematic analysis

Your mini-dissertation can focus deeply on one domain or integrate multiple domains like this example.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# PART 3: METHODS {.section-divider}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Experimental Paradigms: Production {.content-slide}

::: slug-header
Methods
:::

**How do we get people to lie in the lab?**

1. **Cheating tasks** — dice rolling, coin flipping, matrix tasks (Shalvi et al., 2011). Participants self-report outcomes with opportunity to inflate.

2. **Mock crimes** — participants "commit" a mock theft then are interviewed. Compares truthful vs. deceptive statements in forensic-like context.

3. **False opinion paradigm** — participants instructed to misrepresent attitudes or beliefs. Studies attitude misrepresentation.

4. **Poker/strategic games** — participants play poker hands or deception-based games in natural strategic context.

5. **Faking friendship** — brief micro-interactions where participants instructed to fake closeness. Studies social deception in relationships.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Experimental Paradigms: Detection {.content-slide}

::: slug-header
Methods
:::

**How do we measure detection ability?**

1. **Sender-receiver games** — "Deception Olympics" paradigms where senders lie or tell truth; receivers judge veracity.

2. **Interview coding** — trained coders rate linguistic, nonverbal, or paralinguistic cues from recorded interviews.

3. **AI vs. human judges** — transcripts, audio, or video scored by both algorithms and human raters to compare performance.

4. **Modality manipulations** — same content presented via text, audio-only, video-only, or audio-visual to test channel effects.

5. **Training interventions** — pre-post designs testing whether training improves detection accuracy or shifts response bias.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quantitative Measures {.content-slide}

::: slug-header
Methods
:::

**Lying Attitudes & Tendencies**

- Lie Acceptability Scale (Oliveira & Levine, 2008)
- Lying in Everyday Situations Scale (LiES) (Hart et al., 2019)
- LYin Lying Tendency Scale (Zhou et al., 2024)
- Lying Profile Questionnaire (Makowski et al., 2021)

**Related Constructs**

- Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (BIDR) (Paulhus, 1991)
- Paulhus Deception Scales (PDS) (Paulhus, 1998)
- Bullshit Receptivity Scale (Pennycook et al., 2015)
- Emotional Manipulation Scale (Austin et al., 2007)

**Performance Metrics**

Detection: accuracy, confidence, sensitivity, specificity, d′, ROC curves, calibration

Production: success rate, believability, confidence, consistency, response latency

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Qualitative Methods {.content-slide}

::: slug-header
Methods
:::

**Qualitative approaches provide rich, contextual understanding:**

1. **Lie diaries** (DePaulo & Kashy, 1998) — participants record all lies and social interactions over 7 days

2. **Thematic analysis** — identifying patterns in lie content, motives, targets, and outcomes

3. **Narrative analysis** — examining structure of lies over time; how liars construct false narratives

4. **Discourse analysis** — how lies are linguistically constructed; conversational patterns; power dynamics

5. **Semi-structured interviews** — understanding lived experience of lying or being deceived; strategies; emotions

6. **Ethnographic observation** — observing deception in natural settings (with ethics approval)

7. **Case studies** — deep dives into prolific liars, expert detectors, or "wizards"

8. **Focus groups** — group discussions about lying norms, experiences, attitudes across contexts

# KEY READING {.section-divider}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Primary Reading: Vrij, Hartwig, & Granhag (2019) {.content-slide}

::: slug-header
Key Reading
:::

**Summary**

::: {.smaller}

This comprehensive Annual Review article examines nonverbal communication and deception detection. Key findings:

- Nonverbal cues to deception are **faint and unreliable** (effect sizes typically d < 0.30)
- Human detection accuracy is only ~54% (barely above chance of 50%)
- Verbal cues are more diagnostic than nonverbal cues
- People hold widespread misconceptions about deception cues (e.g., gaze aversion, fidgeting)
- Visual-only detection is least accurate; audio-only is more effective
- Training based on nonverbal cues produces minimal improvements
- Theoretical frameworks include cognitive load, emotional leakage, self-presentation, and interpersonal deception theory
- Future research should examine settings where nonverbal analysis is essential and develop more precise measurements

**Critical insight:** Despite popular belief and media portrayals, there is no "Pinocchio's nose" — no reliable nonverbal sign of deception exists.

## Primary Reading: Denault et al. (2022) {.content-slide}

::: slug-header
Key Reading
:::

**Summary**

::: {.smaller}
This bibliometric overview analyzes over 100 years of social science research on deception and lying. Key findings:

- **7,290 English-language articles** identified from Web of Science (1900-2022)
- Research accelerated dramatically: **44.5% of all articles published 2010-2019**
- Top journal: *Applied Cognitive Psychology* (2.15% of articles)
- Research is **highly interdisciplinary**: psychology, economics, law, criminology, neuroscience
- Leading author: Aldert Vrij (201 articles); most cited: Bella DePaulo (159 citations/article)
- Most used keywords: behavior, lie detection, information, cues, accuracy
- **Critical gap**: Organizations like TSA adopted unfounded "behavioral analysis" programs (e.g., SPOT) despite lack of scientific evidence
- Research extends beyond lie detection to: children's lying behavior, dishonesty, self-deception, interviewing techniques
- **Major challenge**: Communicating scientific findings to practitioners who face "immediate and easy solutions to complex challenges" from pseudoscientific sources

**Critical insight:** Despite substantial scientific knowledge, misconceptions about deception persist in practice, media, and large organizations—sometimes with costly consequences ($212M annually for SPOT program).
